# React

> React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.<br/>**- Wikipedia**

React was developed by Facebook and the first release was in March, 2013.

The current version is 17.x and was released in October 2020.

## Getting your feet wet

It's important to get your hands dirty.

React went through a period where it was extremely difficult to get started, which made it very difficult to walk through tutorials and see things in action.

`create-react-app` was created about 4 years ago in an attempt to greatly simplify the startup experience. Creating an app is fairly simple with this tool, but:

- takes a couple minutes to set up a new project
- 35,335 files
- 5,517 folders
- 138 MB

If we just wanted a disposable playground to answer a quick question, this is a lot of work just to throw it away immediately.

Stackblitz.com to the rescue! It's basically VS Code in the browser. They have pre-built templates for react-apps. You can immediately play around with new concepts and throw it away.

- takes 0 minutes to set up a new project
